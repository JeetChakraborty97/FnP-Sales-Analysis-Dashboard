📊 Executive Summary: Ferns and Petals Sales Analysis Dashboard
🎯 Objective

The project analyzes Ferns & Petals’ 2023 sales data with the goal of uncovering insights on revenue, customer behavior, product performance, and seasonal demand patterns. The dashboard addresses ten key business questions outlined in the problem statement
 to guide strategic decisions on product promotion, customer engagement, and operational efficiency.

🔑 Key Insights
1. Overall Revenue & Performance

Total Revenue exceeded expectations with strong order volumes during festival seasons and Valentine’s week.

Customer Spending: The average order value is around ₹3,500, highlighting customers’ willingness to spend for special occasions.

Delivery Efficiency: Average delivery time is ~5–6 days, but larger orders tend to experience delays, indicating scope for logistics optimization.

2. Monthly Sales Trends

Sales peaked in February (Valentine’s Day), contributing the highest monthly revenue.

Other strong months: August (Raksha Bandhan), October–November (Diwali), and December (Christmas/New Year gifting).

Slower months such as April–June suggest opportunities for off-season promotional campaigns.

3. Product Performance

Top Revenue Generators include premium items such as cakes, flower bouquets, and gift hampers.

Product categories like plants and soft toys performed moderately but show growth potential during personalized gifting occasions.

Top 5 Products consistently contributed a significant share of revenue, justifying focused marketing on these items.

4. Customer & City Analysis

Top 10 Cities (e.g., Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune) accounted for the majority of orders, reflecting strong metro demand.

Tier-2 cities like Indore, Lucknow, and Chandigarh also showed rising adoption, suggesting a growing market outside metros.

High-value customers (spending above average) are largely concentrated in urban centers.

5. Occasion-Based Insights

Valentine’s Day generated the highest revenue, dominated by flowers, cakes, and personalized gifts.

Diwali & Raksha Bandhan drove strong demand for sweets, hampers, and home décor items.

Birthdays & Anniversaries contributed steady year-round revenue, ensuring business stability beyond festival peaks.

6. Operational Insights

Order Quantity vs. Delivery Time: Larger orders correlated with slightly delayed deliveries, stressing the need for supply chain improvements.

Delivery timelines during festive rush periods were longer, suggesting a need for seasonal staffing and better logistics partnerships.

📌 Strategic Recommendations

Boost Seasonal Campaigns: Double down on marketing around Valentine’s, Diwali, and Raksha Bandhan while creating attractive offers for lean months.

Product Mix Optimization: Continue promoting best-sellers (cakes, flowers, hampers) while expanding personalization in categories like plants and soft toys.

Customer Segmentation: Focus loyalty programs on high-value urban customers while tailoring discounts for Tier-2 growth cities.

Logistics Efficiency: Reduce delivery delays by partnering with additional couriers and implementing demand forecasting for festive surges.

Cross-Selling & Upselling: Encourage higher spending by bundling products (e.g., flowers + chocolates, plants + personalized notes).

Occasion-Specific Marketing: Curate collections for each major festival/occasion to match product popularity trends.
